# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 



Title of presentation: Mass shooting (#2)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Strong introduction, interesting ideas for how to predict gun purchases (political, hunting season, media coverage), I like the "problems" section - you definitely know your data/research well! I love the idea of using lag.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- Excluded the "crazy" states from these analyses ?!?!?! - did you look into what might have happened the years of the spikes? What of the increases that continued at their high rate for multiple years (Kentucky?)? 
- Slide *before* "firearm checks and media attention over time": do size and colour mean the same thing? If so, a little too much to look at. 


Title of presentation: Voting (#3)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Analysing the obscure responses (I don't know if I voted, no answer, etc.) would be neat! I also like the random forest. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- Did *you* use a survey package in R? (: 
- Shiny app ==> states make a difference in influence of voting. How would you include this in a model? You could make state a variable, but this would just determine a baseline-sort of judgment for... average state voting status? 
- You're interested in individual records, but if you're including states might you look into state voting data? 


Title of presentation: Yelp (#4)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: *Computing* objectivity - I love it. The predictors you created and found are pretty creative/thought-provoking.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- On preference: there is a difference between rating a type of restaurant and preferring it. Why do people rate restaurants? 


Title of presentation: Chicago crime (#5)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: I like the way you created predictors, e.g. whether a block has a lot of restaurants does a good job of explaining the other types of people/shops that are on that block, and the type of crime that would be committed! Also - Jan 1! That's SO INTERESTING. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- What transformation drastically diminished your row number?
