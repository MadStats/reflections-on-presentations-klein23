# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 



Title of presentation: Mass shooting (#2)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Strong introduction, interesting ideas for how to predict gun purchases (political, hunting season, media coverage), I like the "problems" section - you definitely know your data/research well! I love the idea of using lag.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- Excluded the "crazy" states from these analyses ?!?!?! - did you look into what might have happened the years of the spikes? What of the increases that continued at their high rate for multiple years (Kentucky?)? 
- Slide *before* "firearm checks and media attention over time": do size and colour mean the same thing? If so, a little too much to look at. 


Title of presentation: Voting (#3)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Analysing the obscure responses (I don't know if I voted, no answer, etc.) would be neat! I also like the random forest. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- Did *you* use a survey package in R? (: 
- Shiny app ==> states make a difference in influence of voting. How would you include this in a model? You could make state a variable, but this would just determine a baseline-sort of judgment for... average state voting status? 
- You're interested in individual records, but if you're including states might you look into state voting data? 


Title of presentation: Yelp (#4)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: *Computing* objectivity - I love it. The predictors you created and found are pretty creative/thought-provoking.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- On "preference": there is a difference between rating a type of restaurant and preferring it. Why do people rate restaurants? [somewhat resolved after professor's question]


Title of presentation: Chicago crime (#5)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: I like the way you created predictors, e.g. whether a block has a lot of restaurants does a good job of explaining the other types of people/shops that are on that block, and the type of crime that would be committed! Also - Jan 1! That's SO INTERESTING. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- What transformation drastically diminished your row number? 


Title of presentation: Games (#6)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: This is a really creative idea! I like that made your own features, and came up with a "useful" question. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- I'm a little confused about the definition of an observation for your data, although knowing more about the game might help? 
- What exactly does your model tell you? How do your results help you move forward? [resolved after professor's question]


Title of presentation: H1B (#7)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: This is a neat comparison, politics vs H1B. I love the maps! K means is always fun, too (:

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
- the 'cluster analyis' maps are somewhat confusing, and seem as if a lot is cut off (obviously this is a stylistic criticism)
- what else might be the cause of correlation between democratic counties and higher number of H1B? (I think you touched on this in your limitations slides?) e.g. universities are hiring with H1B, don't they also tend towards democratic?


Title of presentation: Traffic (#8)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: I like how much thought you put into for dealing with missing values. 
Your EDA is great, too. Answers just the questions I was about to ask, clean and clear. I like your explanation for the strange line in the residual plot - it makes complete sense! 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
- In the map plots, it would be helpful if you created your own ranges for the colours. Interpretation is otherwise somewhat difficult. 


Title of presentation: Songs (#9)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Your results are so neat - love being so common, sentiment changing over time. Also, you used the phrase "As time goes by" throughout your presentation - good song (: 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- connect with other data? 
- Did you do any analysis on whether the slopes of these lines (decrease in rhyming song score over time) were significant? Sure, they're there, but this is an estimate.
- re: audience comment: I agree - adding genre in would be interesting, but also, genre changes over time, which is part of what you're trying to say. What types of music are people listening to over the years? (i.e. I think the way you're looking at it is okay)


Title of presentation: NBA (#10)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: This data is great. (type of shot, heat maps,...) I know anything about basketball, but these data would be dauntingly dense even if I were a fan, so it's pretty neat what you've done with it. 
Explanation for drop in ...2012? I like it. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- in average 4th quarter points vs. shots taken, how can values be negative?
- make sure to explain the definitions of basketball terms (e.g. field goal... what is this in basketball???) for those who might not understand (in the paper; there wasn't enough time in a 10-min presentation!)
- do you have numbers to back up the interpretations/claims made with, say, the heat maps? 


Title of presentation: Terrorism (#11)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: I like that you clearly define your variables/responses (e.g. intensity = # casualties and incidents).
Animation by region is AWESOME. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
- How could prediction of number killed/wounded apply to the real world? How would it help? 
- Some of the predictors are things that would have already happened, e.g. suicide.
